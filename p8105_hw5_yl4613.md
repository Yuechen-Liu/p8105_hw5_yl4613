## Problem 1

Read in the data.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read.csv('data/homicide-data.csv') %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "-"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "solved"
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa-AL")
```

Let’s look at this a bit

``` r
aggregate_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == 'unsolved')
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Can I do a prop test for a single city?

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% 
    filter(city_state == "Baltimore-MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved),
  aggregate_df %>% 
    filter(city_state == "Baltimore-MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample… two.sided

Try to iterate …..

``` r
results_df =
  aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin =  conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 2

Import and tidy the dataset

``` r
path_df = 
  tibble(
  path = list.files('data_2')) %>% 
  mutate(path = str_c('data_2/',path),
         data = purrr::map(.x = path, ~read.csv(.x))) %>% 
  unnest(data) %>% 
  separate(
    path, into = c('data', 'info'),sep = '/'
  ) %>% 
  separate(
    info, into = c('information', 'csv'), sep = '.csv'
  ) %>% 
  select(-data, -csv) %>% 
  separate(
    information, into = c('arm', 'id'), sep = '_'
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    arm = case_when(
      arm == "con" ~ "control",
      arm == "exp" ~ "experimental")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = 'week',
    names_prefix = 'week_',
    values_to = 'observation')
###End of tidying
```

### Spaghetti plot

``` r
path_df %>% 
  ggplot(
  aes(x = week, y = observation, group = interaction(id, arm)))+
  geom_line(aes(color = arm))+ 
  labs(title = 'Observations on each subject over time')
```

Comment: Two arms of subjects have very similar initial observations.
However, after 8 weeks, the experimental group has generally higher
observations, while control group observations has almost no change in
range of value between its subjects.
